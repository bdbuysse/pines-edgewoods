### About

I aspire to be a life long learner.  In my early years I had the privilige of being born into a family with loving parents who where able to provide for my needs.  I have early memories of the first computer entering our house.  My parents operated a polutry hatchery out of our farm and my Mom used an early IBM PS/2 desktop computer to track customers and their orders on a spreadsheet.
